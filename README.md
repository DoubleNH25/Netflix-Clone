## üìñ Project Overview

This **Netflix Clone** project is a full-stack application that replicates many features of the Netflix UI. It is designed to help you learn and practice:
  
- **User Authentication:** Using [Firebase Auth](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth) to handle signup, login, and session management.
- **Movie Data Retrieval:** Fetching movies, TV shows, and genres from [The Movie Database (TMDB)](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api) API using your API key.
- **UI Development:** Creating a responsive and interactive Netflix-like interface with React, including:
  - Video previews on hover  
  - A sliding carousel for movies
  - Responsive header and navigation
- **Backend Setup:** Utilizing **Express** and **MongoDB** to store user data (e.g., liked movies, watch history).
